# Functional Programming in Scala

## Introduction

These are my completed exercises for the red book.

All exercises are standardized to the `C**E$$.scala` file format, where `**` is the chapter number, and `$$` is the exercise number, respectively.

For example `C02E01.scala` is the file for chapter 2 exercise 1.

## Getting Started

To run tests for exercises you want:

- `sbt`
- `testOnly C02E01Spec`
